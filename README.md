# CSC 205AB - OOP & Data Structures

Welcome to my CSC205 repository! This repository contains projects from my CSC205AB course: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, taken at Paradise Valley Community College with Professor Frisby.

## Course Description

CSC 205AB is a Java course that focuses on object-oriented programming and data structures. Students gain hands-on experience implementing and analyzing OOP features such as inheritance, generics, and exceptions. Additionally, they learn to use popular data structures including linked lists, hash maps, array lists, and queues.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Inheritance
  - Exceptions
  - Recursion
  - Generics
- Data Structures
  - Linked Lists
  - Hash Maps
  - Array Lists
- GUI (Graphical User Interfaces)
- And more
