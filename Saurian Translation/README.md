# Saurian Translation

A Java program that translates text between English and the fictional Saurian language from the game "Star Fox Adventures".

## Description

This Java program consists of two classes that can translate English text to the fictional Saurian language and vice versa. The Saurian language was featured in the game "Star Fox Adventures." Use the provided tester class to demonstrate the translation functionality and this [website](https://saurian.krystalarchive.com/) to compare translations.

## Classes

1. `Saurian.java`: The main class that handles the translation between English and Saurian.
2. `SaurianDriver.java`: The test class that demonstrates the functionality of the Saurian class.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java classes (e.g., `javac Saurian.java SaurianDriver.java`).
2. Run the compiled Java program (e.g., `java SaurianDriver`).
3. The program will output the results of the translation tests, comparing the expected output to the actual output produced by the Saurian class. Each test will display a "Passed!" or "Failed!" message based on the outcome.

## Example

Run the SaurianDriver class to execute the tests and check their results. The output should look like this:

```plaintext
Seccowo
TEST #1 Passed!

Xocce Nehct!
TEST #2 Passed!

Pizza
TEST #3 Passed!

Taking pictures is fun.
TEST #4 Passed!

No one can defeat GENERAL SCALES!
TEST #5 Passed!

Jessoh aj u nuo ev cavo!
TEST #6 Passed!

Seccowo
TEST #7 Passed!

Pizza
TEST #8 Passed!

Xocce Nehct!
TEST #9 Passed!

Taking pictures is fun.
TEST #10 Passed!

English translation:
No one can defeat
Saurian translation:
De edo sud tovouk
```

The example output demonstrates the program's translation capabilities when using the tester.
